File -> New Project
================

This repo is the final product of a time saver presentation that I've given. I've included the CodeTemplates need to generate the Controllers and Views, the EditorFor templates to customize our fields, and the nuget package that can be used to pull it all together.

I hope to keep it updated as I learn new information. Please feel free to fork it and add your own additions and let me know how we can improve our knowledge together!
